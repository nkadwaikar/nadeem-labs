# 🏗️ Week 1 Capstone — Identity‑First, Governance‑Ready Landing Zone  
### *Zero secrets. Zero trust. Fully governed. Fully observable. Fully IaC.*

> **📌 Status:** Coming Soon  
> This capstone is part of my 8-week Azure + AI boot camp. It will be published once all validation and documentation steps are complete.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This capstone demonstrates how to build a secure, identity-driven workload in Azure using:

- Managed Identity  
- Azure Key Vault  
- Azure Storage  
- RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)  
- Azure Policy  
- Resource Locks  
- Azure Monitor + Activity Logs  
- Log Analytics + KQL  
- Modular Bicep (Infrastructure as Code)  

It reflects modern cloud security patterns used across enterprise environments and aligns with NZ/AU hiring expectations.
