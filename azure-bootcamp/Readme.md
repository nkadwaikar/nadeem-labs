This Boot Camp is built for cloud engineers, architects, and security professionals who want more than theory — they want **repeatable, enterprise‑grade Azure labs** that reflect how real systems are designed, deployed, and secured.

Every week includes:

- 7 hands‑on labs  
- 1 capstone project  
- Architecture diagrams  
- Validation steps  
- Bicep deployments  
- Exam alignment (AZ‑104, AZ‑305, AZ‑500, AZ‑700)  

All written with clarity, precision, and just enough coffee to keep things fun ☕.


# 🚦 Getting Started

**Prerequisites:**
- Azure subscription (free or paid)
- VS Code with [Bicep extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-bicep)
- Basic knowledge of cloud concepts

**Setup:**
1. Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/<your-org>/nadeem-labs.git`
2. Open in VS Code
3. Start with [Week 1](./Week1-Identity-Governance/README.md)
4. Follow each week's README and capstone instructions

*Identity‑first. Network‑secure. Architecture‑driven.*

```plaintext
Week 1 → Identity & Governance
Week 2 → Networking & Security (AZ-700)
Week 3 → Compute, App Services & Storage
Week 4 → Monitoring, Backup & Automation
Week 5 → Security Engineering (AZ-500)
Week 6 → Enterprise Architecture & Cost Governance
Week 7 → Architecture Deep Dive (AZ-305)
Week 8 → Azure Landing Zone (Full Build)
```

Each week builds on the last, culminating in a full Azure Landing Zone deployment.
