### 1. Identity Hierarchy (Tenant → Directory → Subscription)
- Microsoft Entra Tenant has a **1:1 mapping** with the Entra Directory.
- The Directory stores **Users, Groups, Devices**, and acts as the identity database.
- One Directory can be linked to **multiple Azure Subscriptions** (1:M mapping).
- Subscriptions inherit identity and RBAC from the Directory.
- Resource Groups and Resources sit under the subscription and follow RBAC inheritance.

### 2. RBAC Scopes and Inheritance
- RBAC hierarchy: **Subscription → Resource Group → Resource**.
- Permissions flow **downward**, never upward.
- Subscription-level roles apply to all RGs and resources.
- RG-level roles apply only to resources inside that RG.
- Resource-level roles enforce **least privilege** and override inherited permissions.

### 3. Privileged Administrator Roles (High-Impact)
These roles have broad, tenant-wide authority and must be tightly controlled.
Examples:
- **Global Administrator** — full control over the tenant.
- **Privileged Role Administrator** — manages role assignments.
- **User Access Administrator** — manages access to Azure resources.
- **Security Administrator** — manages security settings.

Key Findings:
- These roles can modify identity, security, and governance settings.
- They require MFA and should be activated through **PIM**.
- Assign sparingly to reduce risk and maintain compliance.

### 4. Job Function Roles (Operational, Least Privilege)
These roles are task-specific and designed for day-to-day operations.
Examples:
- **Virtual Machine Contributor**
- **Storage Account Contributor**
- **Network Contributor**
- **Website Contributor**

Key Findings:
- These roles support separation of duties.
- They reduce blast radius by limiting access to specific resource types.
- Ideal for DevOps, operations, and engineering teams.

### 5. Managed Identity Access Pattern
- System-assigned Managed Identity is created automatically with the VM.
- It is used to authenticate to Azure services **without secrets**.
- Assigning **Storage Blob Data Reader** at the resource level enables secure access.
- Validation via:
  ```bash
  az login --identity
  az storage blob list --account-name <name> --container-name <container>
